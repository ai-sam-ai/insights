### Can SAM AI help me write outreach emails?

### How do I track which leads are most promising?
SAM scores leads based on engagement, company fit, and behavioral signals. Access the prioritized list through your CRM dashboard or ask SAM directly for your top prospects.

### What CRM integrations are available?
SAM AI is built on Odoo, so native CRM integration is automatic. Leads, contacts, and opportunities sync seamlessly. For external CRMs, use the workflow module to push data.
