## 10. Appendix: Calculation Methodology

### 10.1 Code Valuation Methodology

**Industry Standard Metrics Used:**
- **Embedded systems:** $15-$40/line (high-reliability code)
- **Enterprise software:** $50-$100/line (business-critical applications)
- **Conservative estimate:** $50/line
- **Moderate estimate:** $75/line
- **Aggressive estimate:** $100/line

**Our Module:**
- 570,639 lines × $50 = $28,531,950 (conservative)
- 570,639 lines × $75 = $42,797,925 (moderate)
- 570,639 lines × $100 = $57,063,900 (aggressive)

**Note:** These valuations represent *development cost replacement value*, not market value or selling price.

### 10.2 Market Capture Assumptions

**Why 1-5% is realistic:**

1. **Odoo Market (11,000 customers):**
   - Not all need advanced automation (40% TAM = 4,400)
   - Of those, 10% will adopt in first 3 years = 440
   - 440/11,000 = 4% capture rate ✅

2. **N8N Market (3,000 customers):**
   - Those also using Odoo (estimated 20% = 600)
   - 50% would switch to integrated solution = 300
   - 300/3,000 = 10% capture rate (we used 5% conservatively) ✅

3. **Poppy AI Market (5,000 customers):**
   - Business users (not content creators) = 20% = 1,000
   - Those using Odoo = 10% = 100
   - 100/5,000 = 2% capture rate ✅

**Blended capture rate across all three markets: 3-4% is achievable.**

---

### 10.3 Pricing Assumptions

**Why $30,000/year average for Odoo customers:**
- Current average Odoo spend: $59,091/year
- Automation typically 20-50% of ERP spend
- $30,000 = 50% of current spend (high but defensible with ROI)
- Conservative pricing would be $15,000-$20,000/year

**Why $20,000/year for N8N refugees:**
- Current N8N average: $13,333/year
- Premium for Odoo integration: +50%
- $20,000 represents significant value vs. N8N + custom Odoo connectors

**Why $3,600/year for Poppy AI crossover:**
- Poppy pricing: $1,080-$1,200/year
- Business tools command 3-5x premium vs. creator tools
- $3,600 = 3x Poppy pricing for business ROI
