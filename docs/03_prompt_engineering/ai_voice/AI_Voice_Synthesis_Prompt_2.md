## AI Voice Synthesis Prompt

## Instructions for Use

After both individuals have completed their questionnaires independently:

- 1. Save each person's completed questionnaire as separate files

- 2. Use the prompt below, inserting both completed questionnaires

- 3. The AI will create a unified voice guideline


## Prompt to Feed the AI

I need you to analyze two independently completed questionnaires about AI voice, content tone, and work values. These are from business partners who need to create a unified content voice that works for both.

Your job is to:
1. Identify the shared core values (the foundation)
2. Identify complementary strengths (where differences are assets)
3. Identify potential friction points (where compromise is needed)
4. Create a practical, actionable AI Voice Guide

Do NOT show the raw comparison or call out individuals. Create the synthesis as if it's a third, independent voice that naturally honors both perspectives.


### QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSE SET 1:

[PASTE FIRST PERSON'S COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRE HERE]


### QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSE SET 2:

[PASTE SECOND PERSON'S COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRE HERE]


### Please Create:

#### 1. Core Values Foundation (3-5 principles)

What both perspectives agree on, stated as principles for all content.

Example format:
• [Principle Name]: [What this means in practice]


#### 2. Our AI Voice Profile

Synthesize into a cohesive voice description including:
• Personality: [3-4 adjectives that work for both]
• Tone: [Describe the balanced tone]
• Style: [How this voice communicates]
• What makes us different: [Unique positioning]


#### 3. Content Quality Framework

Create clear "done" criteria that satisfy both perspectives:

Must Have (Non-Negotiables):
• [List items both marked as critical]

Should Have (Strong Preference):
• [List items valued by both]

Speed vs Polish Protocol:
• [Create if/then rules for when to optimize for speed vs when to optimize for quality]


#### 4. Practical Writing Guidelines

Always Include:
• [Elements both value]

Never Include:
• [Things both want to avoid]

Preferred Language:
• Use: [Words/phrases both selected]
• Avoid: [Words/phrases both rejected]

Structure:
• [How content should be organized]


#### 5. The Compromise Protocol

Create specific scenarios with decision rules:

Customer-facing content:
• Standard: [What's the baseline]
• Review trigger: [When extra review is needed]
• Timeline: [Default turnaround]

Internal/marketing content:
• Standard: [What's the baseline]
• Review trigger: [When extra review is needed]
• Timeline: [Default turnaround]

New opportunity evaluation:
• [Rules for when to pursue vs when to defer]


#### 6. Voice Examples

Rewrite this sample message in YOUR synthesized voice:

Generic version: "We provide Odoo consulting services to help businesses implement ERP solutions that improve efficiency."

Our Voice Version: [Rewrite this in the synthesized voice that balances both perspectives]

Then create 2 more examples:
• Email to potential customer: [Write 3-4 sentences]
• Social media post: [Write 2-3 sentences]


#### 7. Red Flags Checklist

Before shipping any content, check for these red flags:
☐ [List specific things that would concern either perspective]
☐ [Include both "sounds too generic" AND "too slow to ship" type concerns]


#### 8. The Success Metrics

Based on both 6-month visions, our content is working when:
• [Synthesized success criteria]


#### 9. Ready-to-Use Content Approval Questions

When reviewing AI-generated content, ask:
1. [Question that addresses perspective 1's core concern]
2. [Question that addresses perspective 2's core concern]
3. [Question about customer value]
4. [Question about action/revenue]
5. [Final gut-check question]

If YES to all 5, ship it.


#### 10. The Partnership Agreement

Based on the concerns and values expressed:

When to prioritize speed: [Specific conditions]
When to prioritize precision: [Specific conditions]
When you're stuck: [Tiebreaker rule]


Make this practical, specific, and immediately usable. This is not theoretical—they need to make money together using this voice starting today.

- 2. Test it on 2-3 pieces of existing content

- 3. Adjust any guidelines that don't feel right

- 4. Save the final version as your official "AI Voice Guide"
