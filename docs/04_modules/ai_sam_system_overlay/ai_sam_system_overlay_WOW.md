# SAM AI System Overlay

## DEPRECATED - Use sam_ui_theme Instead

---

### This Module Has Been Retired

The system overlay functionality that was in this module has been consolidated into `sam_ui_theme` for a cleaner, more maintainable architecture.

**What's better in sam_ui_theme:**
- All UI theming in one place
- Unified overlay management
- Modal/Dialog styling included
- Easier to maintain and extend

---

### Migration Is Simple

1. **Uninstall** `ai_sam_system_overlay`
2. **Upgrade** `sam_ui_theme` to v18.0.20.0.0+
3. **Delete** the old module files

That's it. Your overlays will continue working exactly as before.
