# SAM AI Page Builder

## Describe Your Page. Watch It Appear.

---

### The Problem You Know Too Well

You need a landing page. Or a sales page. Or a documentation page. You know what you want it to DO, but you don't know HTML, CSS, or where to start.

You could:
- Learn web development (weeks)
- Hire a designer (expensive, slow)
- Use a page builder (still need design skills)
- Copy a template (looks like everyone else)

**It doesn't have to be this way.**

---

### What If You Could Just DESCRIBE Your Page?

Imagine typing: "Create a landing page for my SaaS product. Blue and white theme, hero section with signup form, three features with icons, testimonial from a happy customer, and a final call to action."

And then watching it appear in real-time. Responsive. Styled. Ready to publish.

**That's SAM AI Page Builder.**

### The WOW Factor

| **Natural Language Input** | Describe what you want in plain English |
| **Live Preview** | See your page as it's being generated |
| **Iterative Refinement** | "Make the header bigger" - instant changes |
| **Complete Code** | HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - all generated |
| **One-Click Publish** | Push to your Odoo website instantly |
| **Prompt History** | Track every iteration for each page |

### How It Works

1. **Describe Your Vision** - Type what you want in the chat panel
2. **AI Generates** - Claude creates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
3. **Preview Live** - See your page in the right panel
4. **Refine** - Request changes, watch them happen
5. **Publish** - One click to your Odoo website

### Example Prompts

| "Build a sales page for an online course about photography" | Hero, benefits, testimonials, pricing, CTA |
| "Make a contact page with a form and Google Maps" | Form layout with map placeholder |
| "Now make the header sticky" | Updated CSS, instant preview |
