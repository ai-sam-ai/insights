# SAM AI Base

## The Brain Behind Your Business Intelligence

---

### The Problem You Know Too Well

Every day, you're switching between AI tools - one for writing, another for analysis, yet another for voice. Each one forgets who you are the moment you close the tab. You spend hours re-explaining your business context to tools that should already know.

And when something goes wrong? Good luck figuring out which AI service broke, or why your costs suddenly spiked.

**It doesn't have to be this way.**

---

### What If Your AI Actually Remembered You?

Imagine an AI assistant that knows your business inside out. Instead of starting from scratch every conversation, you simply continue where you left off. SAM knows your preferences, understands your workflow, and gets smarter the more you work together.

And the best part? All your data stays in YOUR database - not scattered across a dozen cloud services.

**That's SAM AI Base.**

### The WOW Factor

| What You Get | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **One Brain, Many Providers** | Connect Claude, OpenAI, Google, Azure from one place - switch providers without losing your history |
| **Perfect Memory** | SAM remembers your conversations, preferences, and business context - no more repeating yourself |
| **Smart Cost Control** | Automatic tracking of every AI call - know exactly what you're spending and why |
| **Context Awareness** | SAM knows where you are in Odoo and provides relevant help automatically |
| **Privacy by Design** | Your data stays in your database - with YOU in control of what SAM remembers |

---

### How It Works (The Simple Version)

1. **Connect your providers** - Add your API keys for Claude, OpenAI, or any supported provider
2. **Start chatting** - Talk to SAM anywhere in Odoo - it knows where you are and what you're working on
3. **SAM learns** - With your permission, SAM remembers important facts about your business and preferences
4. **Get smarter together** - Over time, SAM becomes your personalized business intelligence partner

**That's it.** No complicated setup. No data export. Just results.

### Real Results

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 10+ minutes explaining context each session | Instant - SAM already knows |
| No idea how much AI is costing you | Real-time cost tracking per conversation |
| Different AI tools for different tasks | One unified interface for all providers |
| Data scattered across services | Everything in your Odoo database |

---

### Who Is This For?

**SAM AI Base is perfect for:**

- Business owners who want AI that actually understands their business
- Teams tired of re-explaining the same context to AI tools
- Organizations that need control over their AI costs
- Anyone who values privacy and wants their data in their own database

**This probably isn't for you if:**

- You enjoy starting fresh every AI conversation (we can't help you there)
- You don't use Odoo
- You only use AI once in a blue moon
