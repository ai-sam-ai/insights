# QR Code Generator

## Create Professional QR Codes in Seconds - With Your Brand, Your Colors, Your Way

---

### The Problem You Know Too Well

Every time you need a QR code, you end up on some random website. You upload your logo, pick your colors, then realize you can't download without paying. Or the free version adds a watermark. Or it's low resolution. And don't even think about keeping track of which QR codes you've created.

**There's a better way.**

### What If You Owned Your QR Codes?

Imagine creating QR codes directly in Odoo - where your business already lives. Custom colors that match your brand. Your logo perfectly centered. Download instantly as PNG. And every QR code you create is saved and searchable.

**That's QR Code Generator.**
