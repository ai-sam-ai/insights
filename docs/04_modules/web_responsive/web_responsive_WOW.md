# Web Responsive

## Odoo That Works on Every Device

---

### The Problem You Know Too Well

You open Odoo on your phone. The menu is tiny. Buttons are impossible to tap. Lists scroll horizontally. Forms require zooming and squinting.

Your tablet? Better, but still awkward. The desktop interface just doesn't adapt.

**The backend should work everywhere.**

---

### What If Odoo Was Truly Responsive?

Imagine a fullscreen app menu that's easy to navigate on any screen. Sticky headers that stay visible while you scroll. Checkboxes you can actually tap. Controls that adapt to your device.

On mobile, buttons become icons. On desktop, keyboard shortcuts speed up your work. Side-by-side document viewing with chatter. Everything just works.

**That's Web Responsive.**

### The WOW Factor

| What You Get | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Fullscreen App Menu** | Beautiful navigation on all devices |
| **Quick Menu Search** | Find any app instantly with fuzzy search |
| **Sticky Headers/Footers** | Always see column names and totals |
| **Sticky Form Statusbar** | Track record status while scrolling |
| **Bigger Checkboxes** | Easy to tap on touch screens |
| **Mobile Control Panel** | Icons save space on small screens |
| **Better Keyboard Shortcuts** | Alt+Shift+NUM avoids browser conflicts |
| **Side-by-Side Document Viewer** | Read attachments alongside chatter |
| **Color-Coded Composer** | Public vs internal message visual cue |

### Features for Mobile

When screen space is precious:

- **Icon Buttons:** Control panel uses icons instead of text
- **Mobile Chatter:** Followers and send visible, avatars hidden
- **Big Form Inputs:** Easier typing on small screens
- **View Picker Dropdown:** Comfortable selection on touch

---

### Features for Desktop

Power users get even more:

**Better Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- Alt + Shift + [NUM] for app switching (avoids Firefox tab conflicts)
- Alt + S for Save (one-handed!)
- Arrow keys to navigate app search
- Enter to select, Esc to close

**Side-by-Side Document Viewer:**
Read documents alongside chatter. Maximize button for full view when needed.

**Color-Coded Messages:**
Public messages look different from internal notes. Never accidentally post publicly again.

### Personalize Your Experience

Each user can choose:

**Search Type:**
- Canonical - Standard exact matching
- Fuse - Fuzzy search (finds "custmer" when you meant "customer")
- Command Palette - Power user command-style search

**Theme:**
- Milk - Light, clean appearance
- Community - Classic OCA style

**Redirect Preference:**
Choose to go to dashboard or home action after login.

### Who Is This For?

**Web Responsive is perfect for:**

- Teams using Odoo on tablets in warehouses
- Sales reps checking Odoo on phones
- Anyone tired of squinting at tiny menus
- Power users who want keyboard shortcuts

**This probably isn't for you if:**

- You use Odoo Enterprise web module (incompatible)
- You prefer the default interface
- You never access Odoo on mobile
