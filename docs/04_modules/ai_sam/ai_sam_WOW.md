## Your Business Gets an AI Brain That Actually Understands Odoo

---

### The Problem You Know Too Well

Every day, you're juggling between your Odoo system and external AI tools. You copy data from Odoo, paste it into ChatGPT, wait for a response, then manually enter the results back into Odoo. When you need context from last month's conversation, you're scrolling through endless chat histories. And when something goes wrong, your AI has no idea what your business actually does.

**It doesn't have to be this way.**

---

### What If Your AI Lived Inside Odoo?

Imagine an AI that sees your customers, knows your products, and remembers every conversation you've ever had with it. Instead of explaining your business context every time, you simply ask. Your AI already knows. And the best part? It learns and remembers, building a knowledge graph that makes it smarter with every interaction.

**That's SAM AI.**

### The WOW Factor

| What You Get | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **AI Chat Inside Odoo** | No more switching between apps - talk to AI right where you work |
| **Memory That Never Forgets** | Your AI remembers past conversations and learns from them |
| **206 AI Providers** | Use Claude, OpenAI, Google, or 200+ others - your choice, one interface |
| **Visual Workflow Builder** | Drag-and-drop automation without writing code |
| **Cost Intelligence** | Know exactly what you're spending on AI before it surprises you |
| **Team Collaboration** | Share AI conversations and insights with your whole team |
| **MCP Server Generation** | Connect Claude Desktop directly to your Odoo data |
| **Hierarchical AI Agents** | Chain prompts together like a team of specialized assistants |

### How It Works (The Simple Version)

1. **Install and Configure** - Add your API key for your preferred AI provider (takes 2 minutes)
2. **Start Chatting** - Click the chat bubble or navigate to SAM AI. Ask anything about your business.
3. **Watch It Learn** - SAM remembers your conversations and builds connections between topics
4. **Get Smarter Results** - Over time, SAM's answers become more relevant because it knows YOUR business

**That's it.** No complicated setup. No manual data entry. Just an AI that gets smarter the more you use it.

### Real Results

| Guessing what AI usage costs | Real-time cost tracking per model |

| Keeping AI knowledge in your head | Team workspaces share everything |

### Who Is This For?

**SAM AI is perfect for:**

- Business owners who want AI that understands their Odoo data
- Teams tired of explaining the same context to AI over and over
- Operations managers looking to automate without coding
- Finance teams who need to track and control AI spending
- Anyone who uses Odoo and wants AI to make it smarter

**This probably isn't for you if:**
