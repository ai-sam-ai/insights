# Mobile Timesheet

## Track Your Time From Anywhere - Even Your Phone

---

### The Problem You Know Too Well

Your team is out in the field, on-site with clients, or working remotely. When they get back to the office, they try to remember what they worked on all day. Hours get lost. Projects get undercharged. And those "quick" timesheet entries pile up into a Friday afternoon nightmare.

**Time tracking shouldn't wait until you're back at your desk.**

---

### What If You Could Track Time On The Go?

Imagine your team pulling out their phones after finishing a task and logging the time right there. Start time, end time, project, task - all captured while it's fresh. No more guessing. No more forgotten hours. No more end-of-week scrambles.

**That's Mobile Timesheet.**

### The WOW Factor

| What You Get | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Mobile-Friendly Portal** | Works on any phone or tablet |
| **Start/End Time Tracking** | Know exactly when work happened |
| **Work Type Categories** | Categorize labor for better reporting |
| **Billable & Paid Tracking** | Know what to invoice and what's been paid |

---

### How It Works (The Simple Version)

1. **Open the portal** - On your phone, tablet, or computer
2. **Select date and project** - Pick where you worked
3. **Enter your time** - Start, end, duration, description
4. **Save** - Entry goes straight to Odoo

**That's it.** No app to install. No sync to wait for. Just real-time time tracking.
