# Create User from Employee

## One Click to Give Your Team System Access

---

### The Problem You Know Too Well

Every time you hire someone, it's the same dance. First, you create them in HR as an employee. Then you have to go to Settings, create a user account, type in all the same information again, and hope you spelled their email correctly both times.

**It's double work. And it's error-prone.**

---

### What If Onboarding Was Instant?

Imagine finishing an employee profile and clicking one button. That's it - they have system access. Their name, email, and photo are already there. No copy-pasting. No typos. No switching between screens.

**That's Create User from Employee.**

---

### The WOW Factor

| What You Get | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **One-Click User Creation** | Stop entering the same data twice |
| **Automatic Data Sync** | Name, email, and photo copied instantly |
| **Archive Without Deleting** | Disable access but keep the history |
| **Quick Reactivation** | Bring back archived users in seconds |

---

### How It Works (The Simple Version)

1. **Open an employee profile** - Find them in HR
2. **Click "Link to a user"** - Button appears in the header
3. **Done** - They can now log in with their work email

**That's it.** No forms to fill. No settings to configure. Just results.

### Real Results

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 5-10 minutes per new user | 5 seconds per new user |
| Manual data entry errors | Zero - data copied automatically |
| Hunting through Settings menu | Never leave the employee form |

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if the employee doesn't have an email?**
A: The work email field is used as the login. Employees need a work email set before creating their user.

**Q: Will it create duplicate partners?**
A: The module links to existing partner records where possible. If the employee already has an address, it uses that.

**Q: Can I customize what gets copied?**
A: The module copies name, email, and photo by default. Custom fields would need developer modification.
