## Finally - Hide the Header on Just ONE Page

---

### The Hidden Feature Odoo Forgot to Surface

Did you know Odoo already has per-page header visibility control? The field exists. It works. But there's no UI to access it.

Every time you wanted a clean landing page without the navigation header, you had to dig through technical settings or write custom code.

**SAM AI Website Management surfaces the hidden controls.** Now it's just a checkbox in Page Properties.

### What You Get

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Show Header toggle** | Hide the header/menu on specific pages only |
| **Show Footer toggle** | Hide the footer on specific pages only |
| **Backend bug fix** | Prevents JavaScript errors in navbar dropdowns |

---

### How To Use

1. Go to Website > Pages
2. Open a page for editing
3. Click Page Properties (gear icon)
4. Uncheck "Show Header" to hide the header
5. Save

**That's it.** No site-wide settings. No code. Just per-page control.

### Perfect For

- Landing pages that need clean, distraction-free layouts
- Funnel pages where you don't want navigation
- Embedded pages in iframes
- Any page where the standard header/footer gets in the way
