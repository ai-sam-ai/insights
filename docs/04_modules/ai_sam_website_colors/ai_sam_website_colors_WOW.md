# SAM AI Website Colors

## Goodbye Odoo Purple, Hello SAM AI Blue

---

### One Install. Instant Branding.

Odoo's default purple (#875A7B) is fine... for Odoo. But your website should look like YOUR brand.

SAM AI Website Colors instantly replaces Odoo's purple with SAM AI Blue (#4A90FF) across your entire website. Buttons, links, headers - everything gets the professional blue treatment.

**No configuration. No settings pages. Just install and done.**
