# R&D Project Export

## Track and Export Your R&D Projects

---

### The Problem You Know Too Well

You have projects that qualify as Research & Development. You need to track them separately, pull financials together, and generate reports for tax credits or internal analysis. But all your projects look the same in Odoo. Extracting R&D data means manual filtering and spreadsheet work.

**R&D reporting shouldn't be this painful.**

### What If R&D Projects Had Their Own Export?

Imagine marking a project as "R&D" with a simple checkbox. Then clicking one button to export all R&D projects with their bills, purchases, and invoices into a formatted Excel file. Ready for your accountant or tax advisor.

**That's R&D Project Export.**

### The WOW Factor

| What You Get | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **R&D Project Flag** | Easily identify which projects qualify |
| **One-Click Export** | All R&D projects in one Excel file |
| **Financial Summary** | Bills, purchases, invoices per project |
| **Formatted Output** | Color-coded, totaled, ready to use |

---

### How It Works (The Simple Version)

1. **Flag R&D projects** - Check "R and D Project" on qualifying projects
2. **Go to project list** - Navigate to the Projects view
3. **Click Export** - R&D Export button in the list view
4. **Get Excel file** - Download with all R&D project financials

**That's it.** No manual filtering. No copy-paste. Just clean data.

### What's in the Export?

For each R&D project:
- Project name, creation date, custom reference
- **Purchases Bills** - Vendor bills with totals and amounts due
- **Purchases** - Purchase orders with vendor info
- **Invoices** - Customer invoices with dates and amounts

All color-coded and totaled for easy reading.

### Who Is This For?

**R&D Project Export is perfect for:**

- Companies claiming R&D tax credits
- Finance teams tracking R&D spending
- Project managers reporting on innovation projects

**This probably isn't for you if:**

- You don't have R&D projects
- You don't need separate project tracking
- You prefer manual spreadsheet work
