# TLS Business Model

## Link Odoo to Google Drive

---

### The Problem You Know Too Well

Every client has a folder in Google Drive. Every project has documents. Every lead needs files attached.

But where's the folder? You open Google Drive, navigate through nested folders, try to remember the client name spelling, scroll through dozens of subfolders...

**Finding the right folder shouldn't be a treasure hunt.**

### What If Every Record Had a Direct Link?

Imagine opening a contact in Odoo and clicking directly to their Google Drive folder. No navigation. No searching. Just click and you're there.

Same for projects. Same for leads. One click to the right folder.

**That's TLS Business Model.**

### The WOW Factor

| What You Get | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Google Folder on Contacts** | Click to open client's Drive folder |
| **Google Folder on Projects** | Quick access to project documents |
| **Google Folder on Leads** | Documents ready during sales process |
| **Google Maps on Contacts** | One-click directions to client location |
| **Payment Terms on Leads** | Capture terms during sales process |

### How It Works (The Simple Version)

1. **Open a contact** - See Google Folder and Google Map fields
2. **Paste the URL** - Add the Google Drive folder link
