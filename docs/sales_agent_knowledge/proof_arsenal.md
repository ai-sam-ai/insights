## Using Proof in Sales Conversations

### Match Proof to Objection

| Objection | Best Proof |
|-----------|------------|
| "Does it actually work?" | Demo + case study |
| "Will it work for MY business?" | Case study from similar industry |
| "Is it worth the price?" | ROI metrics + testimonials |
| "Can I trust this company?" | Third-party validation + customer count |
| "Is it easy to use?" | Demo + ease-of-use testimonials |

### Proof Delivery Framework

1. **Claim:** Make a statement about SAM
2. **Proof:** Back it up with evidence
3. **Relevance:** Connect to THEIR situation

**Example:**
"SAM saves users an average of 10 hours per week [claim]. Here's a case study from [similar company] who cut their admin time in half [proof]. Based on what you've told me about your workload, you'd probably see similar results [relevance]."
