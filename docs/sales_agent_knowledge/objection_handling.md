# Objection Handling Matrix

> **Purpose:** Equip the Sales Agent with responses to common prospect objections
> **Framework:** Acknowledge → Reframe → Resolve → Advance

---

## Price Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Acknowledge:** "I understand - investing in new software is a real decision."

**Reframe:** "Let me ask: what's the cost of NOT having an AI assistant handling your routine tasks? If SAM saves you 10 hours a week, that's 520 hours a year. What's your time worth?"

**Resolve:** "Most of our users see ROI within the first month. The question isn't whether you can afford SAM - it's whether you can afford to keep doing things the slow way."

**Advance:** "Would it help to see a quick demo of how SAM handles [their specific pain point]?"

---

### "I need to think about it"

**Acknowledge:** "Of course - this is an important decision."

**Reframe:** "What specifically would you like to think through? Is it the fit, the price, or something else?"

**Resolve:** [Based on their answer, address the real objection]

**Advance:** "While you're thinking, would it be helpful if I sent you a case study from someone in a similar situation?"

---

### "I need to check with my team/partner"

**Acknowledge:** "That makes sense - getting buy-in is important."

**Reframe:** "What do you think their main concern would be?"

**Resolve:** "Would it help if I prepared a quick summary you could share with them? I can highlight the key benefits and ROI."

**Advance:** "When are you meeting with them? I can make sure you have everything you need."

---

## Timing Objections

### "Not right now / Maybe later"

**Acknowledge:** "I hear you - timing matters."

**Reframe:** "Just curious: what would need to change for the timing to be right?"

**Resolve:** "Here's what I've noticed: the businesses that wait usually wish they'd started sooner. Every week without SAM is another week of [pain point they mentioned]."

**Advance:** "What if you started with just one use case? That way you can see results without a big commitment."

---

### "We're too busy to implement something new"

**Acknowledge:** "I get it - you're already stretched thin."

**Reframe:** "That's actually why SAM exists. You're too busy because you're doing things manually that SAM can automate."

**Resolve:** "Implementation takes less than a day. And once SAM is running, it starts giving you time back immediately."

**Advance:** "What's the one task that eats up most of your time? Let me show you how SAM handles that."

---

## Trust Objections

### "How do I know this actually works?"

**Acknowledge:** "That's a fair question - you should be skeptical."

**Reframe:** "What kind of proof would be most convincing for you? Case studies? A demo? Talking to a current user?"

**Resolve:** [Provide relevant proof based on their answer]
- "Here's a case study from [similar business]..."
- "Let me show you a quick demo..."
- "I can connect you with [reference customer]..."

**Advance:** "Would seeing SAM handle a real task from your business help?"

---

### "I've tried AI tools before and they didn't work"

**Acknowledge:** "I'm sorry you had that experience. A lot of AI tools over-promise."

**Reframe:** "What specifically went wrong with those tools?"

**Resolve:** "SAM is different because [specific differentiator relevant to their past failure]. We're built on Odoo, so it actually understands your business data - not just generates generic text."

**Advance:** "Would you be open to seeing how SAM handles the specific thing that failed with other tools?"

---

### "Is my data secure?"

**Acknowledge:** "Data security is critical - you're right to ask."

**Resolve:** "SAM runs on your own infrastructure. Your data never leaves your environment. We use enterprise-grade encryption, and you control all access permissions."

**Advance:** "Would you like me to walk you through our security architecture?"

---

## Fit Objections

### "Is this right for my business/industry?"

**Acknowledge:** "Good question - fit matters."

**Reframe:** "Tell me more about your business. What are the main challenges you're facing?"

**Resolve:** [Connect their challenges to SAM's capabilities]

**Advance:** "Based on what you've shared, here's exactly how SAM would help with [specific challenge]..."

---

### "We're too small / too big for this"

**Too Small:**
**Resolve:** "Actually, smaller teams get the most leverage from SAM. You don't have the luxury of hiring specialists for every task. SAM becomes your AI team member."

**Too Big:**
**Resolve:** "SAM scales with you. Larger teams use SAM to standardize processes across departments and ensure everyone has access to AI capabilities."

**Advance:** "What's your team size? Let me show you how similar-sized companies use SAM."

---

### "We already use [competitor/alternative]"

**Acknowledge:** "Got it - you have something in place."

**Reframe:** "How's that working for you? What do you wish it did better?"

**Resolve:** [Address gaps in their current solution that SAM fills]

**Advance:** "Would it be valuable to see how SAM compares on [their pain point]?"

---

## Technical Objections

### "Will it integrate with our existing systems?"

**Resolve:** "SAM is built on Odoo 18, which has native integrations with most business tools. Plus, we have N8N workflow automation built in - that connects to 500+ apps."

**Advance:** "What systems are you using? I can confirm the integration path."

---

### "What's the learning curve?"

**Resolve:** "SAM is conversational - you just talk to it like you would a colleague. Most users are productive within the first hour. No training required."

**Advance:** "Would you like to try asking SAM a question right now?"

---

## Response Framework

For any objection not covered above, follow this framework:

1. **Acknowledge** - Show you heard them (never dismiss)
2. **Clarify** - Ask a question to understand the real concern
3. **Reframe** - Shift perspective (cost → investment, risk → opportunity)
4. **Resolve** - Provide specific answer with proof if possible
5. **Advance** - Move toward next step (demo, trial, call, purchase)

---

## Escalation Rules

**Escalate to human when:**
- Prospect asks for custom pricing
- Prospect mentions legal/compliance requirements
- Prospect requests reference call with existing customer
- Prospect expresses frustration with the agent
- Objection has been addressed 2+ times without resolution

**Escalation message:**
"I want to make sure you get the best answer on this. Let me connect you with [Anthony/Sales Team] who can help with [specific need]. What's the best way to reach you?"
