# Urgency Triggers

> **Purpose:** Create legitimate reasons for prospects to act now, not later
> **Principle:** Urgency must be real and ethical - manufactured scarcity destroys trust

## The Psychology of Urgency

People delay decisions because:
1. **Fear of making wrong choice** → Solve with proof/guarantee
2. **No perceived cost of waiting** → Solve with cost of inaction
3. **Other priorities seem more urgent** → Solve with opportunity cost
4. **Comfort with status quo** → Solve with future pain amplification

**Key insight:** Real urgency comes from helping prospects see what they're losing by waiting, not from fake countdown timers.

## Cost of Inaction Messaging

### Time Cost

**Framework:** "Every [time period] without SAM is [X hours] lost to [manual task]."

**Examples:**
- "Every week you wait is another 10+ hours spent on tasks SAM could handle."
- "That's 40 hours a month - a full work week - doing things the hard way."
- "In 3 months, that's 120 hours. What could you build with 120 extra hours?"

---

### Opportunity Cost

**Framework:** "While you're doing [manual task], your competitors are [better outcome]."

**Examples:**
- "While you're manually copying data between systems, AI-enabled competitors are closing deals."
- "Every hour spent on admin is an hour NOT spent with customers."
- "The businesses adopting AI now will have a 2-year head start. Can you catch up later?"

---

### Compound Cost

**Framework:** "The problem doesn't stay the same - it gets worse."

**Examples:**
- "Your data chaos grows every day. The longer you wait, the bigger the cleanup."
- "Manual processes that work for 10 customers break at 100. Are you ready for growth?"
- "Technical debt compounds. Fixing this in 6 months will cost 3x what it costs today."

---

## Legitimate Scarcity

### Capacity-Based

**When real:** "We onboard [X] new customers per month to ensure quality support."

**Example messaging:**
- "We have 3 onboarding slots left this month. After that, the next opening is [date]."
- "Our team personally helps each new customer get set up. That limits how many we can take on."

---

### Pricing-Based

**When real:** "Early adopter pricing ends [date] / Prices increase [date]."

**Example messaging:**
- "You're seeing early-stage pricing. Once we hit [milestone], prices go up."
- "Current users are locked in at this rate. New customers after [date] pay the new pricing."

---

### Feature-Based

**When real:** "This bonus/feature is only available during [period]."

**Example messaging:**
- "Launch customers get [bonus] included. That won't be part of the standard package."
- "We're offering free migration assistance this month only."

## Trigger Phrases for the Sales Agent

### Soft Urgency (Early in Conversation)

- "Just so you know, we can only onboard a limited number of customers each month."
- "I want to mention - our current pricing is early-stage. It won't stay this low."
- "The sooner you start, the sooner SAM starts saving you time."

### Medium Urgency (After Interest Established)

- "Based on what you've told me, every week you wait costs you about [X] hours."
- "If you started today, you'd have SAM running before [upcoming date/event]."
- "What would it mean to have this solved before [their deadline/pain point]?"

### Strong Urgency (At Decision Point)

- "Here's the reality: the work you're doing manually today, you'll still be doing manually in 6 months if nothing changes."
- "You've said this is costing you [pain]. What's the cost of another month of that?"
- "I can hold your spot, but I need to know by [reasonable deadline]. Fair?"

---

## What NOT to Do

**Never use fake urgency:**
- Fake countdown timers that reset
- "Only 2 left!" when there's unlimited supply
- Artificial deadlines with no consequence

**Never pressure:**
- "You HAVE to decide now"
- "This offer expires in 5 minutes"
- Manipulative high-pressure tactics

**Why:** Fake urgency works once, then destroys trust forever. Real urgency builds respect.

---

## Combining Urgency with Empathy

**Framework:** Acknowledge their situation → Show the cost → Offer a path forward

**Example:**
"I totally understand you need to think about this. That's smart. I just want to make sure you're seeing the full picture: every week this isn't solved is another [X] hours of [pain]. If budget is the concern, we have [option]. If it's timing, we can start small and expand later. What would make this easier to move forward?"

## When to Use Urgency

| Stage | Urgency Level | Approach |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Early discovery | None | Focus on understanding pain |
| After demo/interest | Soft | Mention constraints naturally |
| At decision point | Medium | Show cost of inaction |
| Closing | Strong | Create clear deadline |

**Rule:** Urgency without value = pressure. Value without urgency = delay. You need both.
