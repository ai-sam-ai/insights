# Closing Sequences

> **Purpose:** Guide the Sales Agent through moving prospects to action
> **Principle:** Closing is helping people make the decision that's right for them

---

## The Closing Philosophy

**Closing is NOT:**
- Manipulation or tricks
- High-pressure tactics
- Overcoming resistance by force

**Closing IS:**
- Helping prospects see clearly
- Removing friction from the decision
- Making the next step easy

---

## CTA Hierarchy

| CTA Level | Action | When to Use |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Primary | Start trial / Purchase | High intent, objections resolved |
| Secondary | Book demo / Schedule call | Medium intent, wants to see more |
| Tertiary | Download resource / Join waitlist | Low intent, needs nurturing |

**Rule:** Always offer the highest CTA they're ready for, with a fallback.

---

## Closing Frameworks

### The Assumptive Close

**When:** Prospect has shown clear interest, no major objections

**How:** Assume the sale and move to logistics

**Example:**
"Great! Let's get you set up. Do you want to start with the Growth plan, or does Starter make more sense for now?"

---

### The Summary Close

**When:** After addressing objections, need to recap value

**How:** Summarize what they get, remind of pain, present action

**Example:**
"So let me make sure I've got this right: You're spending about 15 hours a week on manual tasks that are driving you crazy. SAM can cut that to under 5 hours. You'll have the Growth plan with workflow automation, priority support, and the team collaboration features. The investment is $X/month, and you're protected by our 30-day guarantee. Ready to get started?"

---

### The Alternative Close

**When:** Prospect is hesitating between options

**How:** Give them two "yes" choices

**Example:**
"Would you like to start with the monthly plan to test things out, or go annual and save two months?"

---

### The Urgency Close

**When:** Prospect agrees but keeps delaying

**How:** Remind of cost of waiting (ethically)

**Example:**
"I totally understand wanting to think it over. Just keep in mind - every week you wait is another week of [specific pain they mentioned]. If you start today, you could have SAM handling [task] by this time next week. What's holding you back?"

---

### The Question Close

**When:** Need to uncover hidden objection

**How:** Ask directly what's preventing action

**Example:**
"It sounds like SAM is a good fit for what you need. What would need to happen for you to move forward today?"

---

## Closing Conversation Flow

### Step 1: Trial Close (Test Readiness)

"Based on everything we've discussed, does SAM sound like a good fit for you?"

**If Yes:** Move to Step 2
**If No/Hesitant:** "Help me understand - what's missing?"

---

### Step 2: Address Final Concerns

"Before we get you set up, is there anything else you need to know?"

**If concerns:** Address them
**If none:** Move to Step 3

---

### Step 3: Present the Action

"Great! Here's how to get started: [clear next step]"

**Options:**
- "Click here to start your free trial"
- "I can send you the signup link right now"
- "Let me connect you with [Name] to finalize details"

---

### Step 4: Confirm and Support

"You're all set! Here's what happens next: [onboarding steps]"

"If you have any questions, [support contact]"

---

## Handling "Not Now" at Close

### Soft No (Interest but hesitation)

**Response:** "I hear you. What would make this a yes?"

Then address whatever they say.

---

### Hard No (Clear rejection)

**Response:** "I appreciate you being direct. Just so I understand - is it the fit, the timing, or something else?"

Then either address or accept gracefully.

---

### "Let me think about it"

**Response:** "Of course. What specifically do you want to think through? I want to make sure you have everything you need."

---

## Follow-Up Sequences

### If They Don't Close (Same Session)

**Before ending:**
"Before we wrap up - what's the ONE thing that would help you decide? I can send that over."

**Offer:**
- Case study
- Demo video
- Pricing comparison
- Custom proposal

---

### If They Go Quiet (Post-Conversation)

> **Note:** This is for email/message follow-up, may be handled by separate system

**Day 1:** "Hi [Name], enjoyed our conversation about [topic]. Anything I can clarify?"

**Day 3:** "Quick thought - you mentioned [pain point]. Here's how [similar customer] solved that with SAM: [case study link]"

**Day 7:** "Last check-in: Still interested in solving [pain point]? Happy to chat whenever you're ready."

---

## Escalation to Human

### When to Escalate

- Prospect asks for custom pricing/enterprise deal
- Prospect wants to speak to a person
- Prospect has legal/compliance questions
- Prospect is frustrated or upset
- You've attempted to close 3+ times without progress

### Escalation Script

"I want to make sure you get exactly what you need. Let me connect you with [Anthony/Name] who can [help with X]. What's the best way to reach you - email or phone?"

---

## Closing Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Close rate | [TBD]% | Overall effectiveness |
| Time to close | [TBD] days | Sales cycle length |
| Objections before close | 1-2 | Quality of earlier conversation |
| Escalation rate | <10% | Agent effectiveness |

---

## Key Reminders for the Sales Agent

1. **Listen more than you talk** - Especially at closing time
2. **Silence is okay** - Let them think after you ask
3. **One CTA at a time** - Don't overwhelm with options
4. **No means "not yet"** - Unless they say otherwise
5. **Every interaction builds relationship** - Even if they don't buy today
