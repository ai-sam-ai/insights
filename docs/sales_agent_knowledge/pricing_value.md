# Pricing & Value Justification

> **Purpose:** Help the Sales Agent explain pricing and justify value
> **Status:** PLACEHOLDER - CEO to provide actual pricing details

## Pricing Philosophy

### Value-Based, Not Cost-Based

SAM AI pricing should reflect:
- Time saved (hours × hourly rate)
- Opportunities captured (leads, sales, efficiency)
- Problems avoided (errors, delays, frustration)

**NOT:** Server costs, development time, feature count

---

## Value Anchoring Framework

### The "What's It Worth?" Calculation

**Framework:** Compare SAM's cost to the alternative

```
Alternative Cost:
- Hiring an assistant: $3,000-5,000/month
- Your own time on tasks: [hours/week] × [hourly rate]
- Lost opportunities: [deals missed] × [average deal value]
- Errors/rework: [hours wasted] × [hourly rate]

SAM's Cost:
- [Pricing TBD]

ROI:
- Alternative cost - SAM cost = Savings
- Savings / SAM cost = ROI multiple
```

---

### Value Anchoring Statements

**For time savings:**
"If SAM saves you just 5 hours a week, that's 260 hours a year. At $50/hour, that's $13,000 in time value. SAM costs [X]. That's a [Y]x return."

**For assistant comparison:**
"A part-time assistant costs $2,000+/month. SAM handles similar tasks 24/7 for a fraction of that. And SAM never calls in sick."

**For opportunity cost:**
"What's one lost deal worth to you? If SAM helps you respond faster and close even one extra deal per month, it pays for itself."

---

## Pricing Philosophy: Growth-Based, Not User-Based

### Why We Don't Charge Per User

**Traditional SaaS:** "Pay per seat" = Punishes growth, creates adoption friction

**SAM AI Philosophy:** As your business grows, your data grows, your infrastructure needs grow. We scale WITH you, not against you.

**Key message:**
"We don't charge per user. Add your whole team - no extra cost. We believe AI should help everyone in your business, not just those with a license."

---

## Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Price | Best For | Infrastructure |
|------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Foundation** | $97/month | Solo founders, small teams (1-5) | Entry-level server |
| **Growth** | $147/month | Growing teams (5-10) | Mid-tier server, more data capacity |
| **Scale** | $197/month | Established businesses (10-15+) | Higher-performance infrastructure |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | 15+ or high-data industries | Custom infrastructure discussion |

### What Determines Your Tier?

**Not users.** It's about:
- **Data volume** - How much your business generates
- **Usage intensity** - How heavily you use AI features
- **Industry type** - Manufacturing/inventory = more data than pure services

**Example:** A 15-person manufacturing company might need Scale tier due to inventory/production data, while a 15-person consulting firm might run fine on Growth.

## Unlimited Users - The Sales Angle

### How to Position This

**Prospect asks:** "How much per user?"

**Response:**
"We don't charge per user - it's unlimited. Add your whole team at no extra cost. Most AI tools charge $20-50 per seat, which means a 10-person team pays $200-500/month just in seat fees. With SAM, your whole team gets AI for $97-197/month total. We think AI should help everyone, not just the people with budget approval."

### The Math (For Comparison)

| Team Size | Per-Seat Tool ($30/user) | SAM AI | Savings |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|---------|
| 5 users | $150/month | $97/month | $53/month |
| 10 users | $300/month | $147/month | $153/month |
| 15 users | $450/month | $197/month | $253/month |
| 20 users | $600/month | Custom | Significant |

**Key point:** "The more people on your team, the more you save compared to per-seat pricing."

---

## Price Objection Responses

### "That's more than I expected"

"I understand. Let me ask: what were you expecting to pay, and what were you comparing it to?"

**If comparing to free tools:**
"Free AI tools like ChatGPT don't know your business data. SAM is integrated with your Odoo - it actually understands your customers, products, and processes. It's the difference between asking a stranger for help versus someone who works for you."

**If comparing to per-seat tools:**
"Most AI tools charge $20-50 per user. For a team of 10, that's $200-500/month - and SAM is unlimited users. At $97-147/month for your whole team, you're actually paying less AND getting more."

---

### "Can I get a discount?"

**If discount available:**
"Let me see what I can do. Are you ready to move forward if we can work something out?"

**If no discount:**
"Our pricing is already set to deliver maximum value. What I CAN do is [offer alternative: longer trial, payment plan, start with smaller tier]."

---

### "What's included?"

[Reference tier features]

"At the [tier] level, you get [features]. The main difference between tiers is [key differentiator]. Based on what you've told me, [recommended tier] makes the most sense because [reason]."

---

### "Why should I pay when free AI tools exist?"

"Great question. Free AI tools like ChatGPT are general-purpose - they don't know your business, your data, or your processes. SAM is built into Odoo, so it actually understands your customers, your products, your workflows. It's the difference between asking a stranger for help versus asking someone who works for you."

## Competitive Pricing Context

| Alternative | Typical Cost | SAM Advantage |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Per-seat AI tools (ChatGPT Team, etc.) | $20-50/user/month | Unlimited users included |
| Hiring an assistant | $2,000-4,000/month | Fraction of the cost, 24/7 availability |
| Custom AI development | $10,000+ upfront | Ready to use, no dev time |
| Doing it manually | Your time × hourly rate | Save 10+ hours/week |

### The "Hiring" Comparison

"Think about it this way: a part-time admin costs $2,000+ per month. SAM handles similar tasks - data entry, lookups, reports, scheduling - for $97-197/month. And SAM works 24/7, never calls in sick, and gets better with your feedback."

### The "Per-Seat" Comparison

"Most enterprise AI charges per user. Notion AI is $10/user. ChatGPT Team is $25/user. Microsoft Copilot is $30/user. For a 10-person team, that's $100-300/month just for AI access. SAM gives your WHOLE team AI for a flat $97-197/month."

---

## Pricing Conversation Flow

1. **Qualify first:** Understand their pain, use case, and budget
2. **Establish value:** Show what SAM does for THEM specifically
3. **Anchor high:** Compare to alternatives (hiring, time cost)
4. **Present pricing:** Position against the anchor
5. **Handle objections:** Use responses above
6. **Close:** Clear CTA with next step

**Never lead with price.** Value first, price second.

## Industry-Specific Pricing Guidance

### High-Data Industries (May Need Higher Tier Sooner)

- **Manufacturing** - Inventory, production, supply chain data
- **E-commerce** - Product catalogs, order history, customer data
- **Healthcare** - Patient records, compliance documentation
- **Logistics** - Tracking, routing, fleet data

### Lower-Data Industries (May Stay on Foundation Longer)

- **Professional services** - Consulting, coaching, agencies
- **Creative services** - Design, marketing, content
- **Small retail** - Limited SKUs, local customer base

**Sales guidance:** "What industry are you in? That helps me recommend the right starting point."
