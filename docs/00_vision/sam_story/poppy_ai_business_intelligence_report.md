## 9. Strategic Recommendations

### Positioning Strategy

**Do:**
- Focus on specific use case (e.g., Odoo automation) rather than generic "AI workspace"
- Emphasize technical differentiation (Odoo integration, specific workflow automation)
- Target business users willing to pay for ROI-driven tools
- Build exceptional onboarding experience from day one

**Don't:**
- Compete on price with ChatGPT/Claude (race to bottom)
- Try to be everything to everyone
- Underestimate importance of visual, intuitive UX
- Launch without clear differentiation from Poppy AI

### Pricing Strategy

**Considerations:**
- Start lower than Poppy AI ($399/year) to gain market entry
- Consider freemium model with clear upgrade path (unlike Poppy)
- Monthly credit limits create friction—explore alternative models
- Business/Enterprise tiers for Odoo-using companies with teams

### Feature Priorities (Based on Poppy AI User Feedback)

**High Priority:**
1. Visual workflow builder (their key differentiator)
2. Odoo-specific integrations (our differentiator)
3. Multi-source content analysis
4. Real-time collaboration
5. Template library for common Odoo workflows

**Medium Priority:**
1. Multiple AI model access
2. Mobile companion app (gap in market)
3. Dark mode (low-hanging fruit)
4. Robust API (more accessible than Poppy's $5,000 tier)

**Low Priority (Nice-to-Have):**
1. Mind mapping (unless critical for Odoo workflow visualization)
2. Social media integrations
3. Advanced analytics
